# Unit 4 | Assignment - Pandas, Pandas, Pandas

## Background

The data dive continues!

Now, it's time to take what you've learned about Python Pandas and apply it to new situations. For this assignment, you'll need to complete **one of two** (not both)  Data Challenges. Once again, which challenge you take on is your choice. Just be sure to give it your all -- as the skills you hone will become powerful tools in your data analytics tool belt.

Congratulations! After a lot of hard work in the data munging mines, you've landed a job as Lead Analyst for an independent gaming company. You've been assigned the task of analyzing the data for their most recent fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli.

Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. As a first task, the company would like you to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.

## Observable Trends

Based on the data, males are overwhelming more likely to make ingame purchases.  Ages between 20 and 24 are more like to make purchase, however ages 35-39 are more likely to buy more expensive ingame items.

Well done! Having spent years analyzing financial records for big banks, you've finally scratched your idealistic itch and joined the education sector. In your latest role, you've become the Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. In this capacity, you'll be helping the  school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, you've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your responsibility is to aggregate the data to and showcase obvious trends in school performance.

## Observable Trends

Based on the data, schools who have higher budgets for each student do not necessarily get better results. School size does not either.  However, charter schools get significantly better results than district schools.
